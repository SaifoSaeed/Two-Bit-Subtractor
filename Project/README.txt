README:

You need IcarusVerilog and some Waveform viewing tool. I use WaveTrace.
You should also install GNU make if you want to run the compilation lines automatically.

Use: type in the following in your terminal to run its respective stage.
1. "make basic" will run the basic gate simulation.
2. "make one" will run the one-bit subtractor simulation.
3. "make two" will run the two-bit subtractor simulation.
4. "make all" will run all the examples in the above order.
5. "make clean" to clean-up all output files and leave source files only.

Enjoy!
